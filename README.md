# SPI_G4_Pulsed_Laser_Control

This is a Python library to interface with an SPI G4 pulsed laser.

This library uses RS232 communication with the laser.

The connect can either be made using the SPI G4 Break-out Board accessory (PT-E01628), or by using the following pins on the 64 way D-sub connector:

RS232_TX - Pin 25

RS232_RX - Pin 26

GND_D - Pins 59, 60
